Of course. A good `README.md` is essential for any project. It serves as the front door, explaining what the project does, how to set it up, and how to use it.

Here is a comprehensive `README.md` file tailored specifically for your full-stack RAG application. It includes sections for local setup with Docker and deployment to Google Cloud.

You can copy and paste this directly into a `README.md` file in the root directory of your project.

# Full-Stack PDF RAG Chat Application

This project is a complete, end-to-end web application that allows users to upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content. It uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern to provide accurate, context-aware answers based solely on the uploaded document.

The application is built with a modern tech stack:
- **Frontend:** React (with Vite) for a fast, interactive user interface.
- **Backend:** Python (with Flask) to handle API requests, file processing, and the RAG pipeline.
- **Vector Database:** Qdrant for efficient similarity search of document chunks.
- **LLM & Embeddings:** OpenAI's models for generating answers and creating vector embeddings.
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose for consistent local development and easy deployment.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run, Artifact Registry, Secret Manager) for a scalable, serverless production environment.

## Features

- **PDF Upload:** Users can upload any PDF document to be indexed.
- **Indexing Pipeline:** The backend processes the PDF, splits it into chunks, creates vector embeddings, and stores them in a Qdrant database.
- **Interactive Chat:** A clean chat interface for users to ask questions.
- **RAG-Powered Answers:** The backend retrieves the most relevant document chunks and uses an LLM to generate a precise answer with source citations.
- **Fully Containerized:** The entire stack (frontend, backend, database) can be run locally with a single command.
- **Cloud-Ready:** Includes configuration for one-command deployment to Google Cloud Platform.

## Getting Started: Local Development with Docker

This is the recommended way to run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose:** Make sure you have them installed on your system. [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- **OpenAI API Key:** You need an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-folder>
    ```

2.  **Create the Backend Environment File:**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory, copy the example `.env` file, and add your OpenAI API key.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open `backend/.env` and paste your key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    ```

3.  **Adjust Application Code for Docker:**
    Ensure your application is configured to communicate between containers.
    - **Backend (`backend/rag_service.py`):** The Qdrant URL should point to the Docker service name.
      ```python
      QDRANT_URL = "http://qdrant:6333"
      ```
    - **Frontend (`frontend/src/App.jsx`):** API fetch calls should use a relative path, which will be proxied by Nginx.
      ```javascript
      // Example for the index endpoint
      const response = await fetch('/api/index', { /* ... */ });
      ```

4.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    From the **root directory** of the project, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will:
    - Build the Docker images for the frontend and backend.
    - Pull the official Qdrant image.
    - Start all three services.

5.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

    The application is now running! You can upload a PDF and start asking questions.

## Deployment to Google Cloud Platform

This section outlines the steps to deploy the application to a scalable, serverless environment on GCP.

### Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with billing enabled.
- The `gcloud` command-line tool installed and configured (`gcloud init`).
- A [Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io/) account (the free tier is sufficient).

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Enable GCP APIs:**
    In your GCP project, enable the following APIs:
    - Cloud Run API
    - Cloud Build API
    - Artifact Registry API
    - Secret Manager API

2.  **Set Up Secrets in Secret Manager:**
    Run these commands to securely store your API keys and URLs.
    ```bash
    # Set your project ID
    gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

    # Store secrets
    echo "sk-..." | gcloud secrets create OPENAI_API_KEY --data-file=-
    echo "https://xyz.cloud.qdrant.io:6333" | gcloud secrets create QDRANT_URL --data-file=-
    echo "YOUR_QDRANT_API_KEY" | gcloud secrets create QDRANT_API_KEY --data-file=-
    ```

3.  **Create an Artifact Registry Repository:**
    This is where your Docker images will be stored.
    ```bash
    gcloud artifacts repositories create rag-app-repo --repository-format=docker --location=us-central1
    ```

4.  **Grant Permissions:**
    The Cloud Build service account needs permission to deploy to Cloud Run and access secrets.
    ```bash
    PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $(gcloud config get-value project) --format='value(projectNumber)')
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT="${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com"

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $(gcloud config get-value project) \
      --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
      --role="roles/run.admin"

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $(gcloud config get-value project) \
      --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
      --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
    ```

5.  **Deploy with Cloud Build:**
    From the project's root directory, trigger the deployment using the `cloudbuild.yaml` configuration file.
    ```bash
    gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
    ```
    Cloud Build will now build your container images, push them to Artifact Registry, and deploy them as two separate services on Cloud Run.

6.  **Access Your Live Application:**
    Once the build is complete, go to the **Cloud Run** section of the GCP Console. Find the service named `rag-frontend` and click on the URL provided. Your application is now live on the internet
